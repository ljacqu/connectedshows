<h1>View Actors</h1>
Shows actors with the most roles in the database's shows.

<form method="post">
  <label for="min">Minimum episode threshold:</label>
  <input type="number" id="min" name="min" min="0" value="{episode_minimum}" />
  <input type="submit" value="Search" />
</form>
<p>
  We only consider the roles of an actor if he has played in
  at least as many episode as in the given minimum. This helps you skip over
  an actor's very minimal roles.

[no_actors_found]
<p>
  No actors could be found. (no actors in database? threshold too high?)
